This repository contains source code for my **Hashnode tutorial series** titled "_[Create a CV/Resume Builder Tool using Django Rest Framework](https://ifenna.hashnode.dev/create-a-cvresume-builder-using-the-django-rest-framework-part-1)_".

CVeate (CV and Create) is an Django application for creating a custom resume/CV similar to [Novo Resume](https://novoresume.com) and [Zety](https://zety.com) resume builders.

The inspiration behind this project was to build something different. I was tired of DRF beginner tutorials on building todo app, note app or blog.
